["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge].

In this challenge, you'll build a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way we'll learn about
event loops, the Redis protocol and more.


# Passing the first stage

The entry point for your Redis implementation is in `app/main.go`. Study and
uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to pass the first stage:

```sh
git commit -am "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```

That's all!

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `go (1.24)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented in
   `app/main.go`.
